# Make_a_Sandwich_take_2

This is my first solo project and I've hit a bit of a bump!  No starter code here, lol!  My goal was to allow a user to create a basic sandwich, building it from scratch. Everything is going great--EXCEPT the pickRandom method.  It's going to need work.

## Learning from Scratch was fun with such an easy project

What I liked most about trying to create this mini-app was that I had to really think about encapsulation.  It also gave me a chance to practice creating a randomizer method, and getting used to the method creation as a new software engineer in general.  

I'm not finished yet--as soon as I can getthis pickRandom method completely debugged--I'll be ready to call it a done deal :)
